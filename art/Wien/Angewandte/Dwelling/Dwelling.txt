metal, wax, matches, security, & heat

This installation is a meditation on formative structures, processes that form and of being formed, the impetus being the indicative representations of material vulnerability and mutability.  The pieces are reflections on the relationships of effect and affect, of manipulating and yielding, of giving form and taking space.  As the objects experience each other, the viewers are melded into empathy with them through the heat and humidity of the room.
