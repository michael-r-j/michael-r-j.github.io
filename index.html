      <td style="width:100px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;"><u>Brief description</u>:</td> <td>Let \(\mathbf{D}^{2}\) be the \(2\)-disk, as it sits in the standard \(\mathbf{R}^{2} \cong \mathbf{C}\), and let \(\mathcal{Z} = \{\zeta_{j}\}_{j=1}^{n} \subset \mathbf{D}^{2}\).  On \(\mathbf{D}^{2} \smallsetminus \{\zeta_{j}\}_{j}\), there is a harmonic function with singularities at \(\mathcal{Z}\):
\[g_{\mathcal{Z}} \left(z\right) := \sum_{j=1}^{n} \ln \left|\frac{\zeta_{j} - z}{1 - \overline{\zeta_{j}} z}\right| .\]
It can be shown that this function has, with multiplicities, \(n-1\) critical points in \(\mathbf{D}^{2} \smallsetminus \{\zeta_{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}\).  Looking at the flow lines of the gradient of \(g_{\mathcal{Z}}\) around a critical point \(\rho\), there are certain flow lines that approach \(\rho\) from \(\partial \mathbf{D}^{2}\), the boundary of \(\mathbf{D}^{2}\), and certain flow lines that recede from \(\rho\) toward some singularity or another critical point.  The main task is to understand the relationship between those singular points \(\mathcal{Z}\) and the points of \(\partial\mathbf{D}^{2}\) which flow approaching some critical point.</td>
