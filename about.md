<p>Currently, working as a Computer Analyst (Support Engineer) at SAP SSC, Ireland.</p>

<p>Recently, a Masters student in Mathematics at Universit√§t Bonn, Germany, wherein my interests are in differential Geometry, specifically symplectic Geometry and geometric Mechanics.  Most awe-inspiring for me, are the functionalities and visualities of the cusps in spatialities &mdash; this is to say, the bearings and limits of abstract spaces.</p>
