<p>Recently, I was working as an ESR (<i>Early-Stage Researcher</i>) at TU Wien to obtain my Ph.D., funded the EU project called the <a href="http://arcades-network.eu/">ARCADES Network</a>.  </p>

<p>As of September 2016, I finished my work as a Computer Analyst (Support Engineer) at SAP SSC, Ireland, after 6 months.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a Master’s student in Mathematics at Universität Bonn, Germany (2012 – 2015), wherein my interests are in differential Geometry, specifically symplectic Geometry and geometric Mechanics.</p>

<p>Most awe-inspiring for me, are the functionalities and visualities of the cusps in spatialities &mdash; this is to say, the bearings and limits of abstract spaces.</p>
