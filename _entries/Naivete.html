<i>pinwheel, ventilation ducts, breath of the WUK</i>
<p>
  »Naïveté« is about both resiliency and vulnerability, particularly in reflection on the past year of the pandemic, and especially in the context of childhood existence.  In a time of uncertainty and disrupted milieu, it is a reflection on feelings of isolation and coping.  It is about finding a space to exist under outside pressures and restrictions, and how unceasing situations can make even typical behaviors seem wearying.<br>
  The singular pinwheel spins without respite, as the exhaust of the WUK's ventilation system is pumped into the <a href="https://www.wuk.at/kunstzelle/">Kunstzelle</a>.  The pinwheel is affected by the outside, but it channels that into being as it can, in the only way it can: it spins, relentlessly.  And as a colorful toy, it is a representation of childhood innocence, something whose simple existence is unapologetic in doing what it does.<br>
  The installation is about how naïveté creates an imperfect bubble of unknowing: it conveys hope, yet also the burden of being affected.
