<p>
  During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a few studio Art courses (2010&ndash;2012), mainly doing sculptural work.  Below is a selection of my work from those courses; they are mixed-media, with predominant use of steel, wood, and twine.  A recurrent theme is exploring space through promoted negative space and constructed tension.
  <table style="width:100%;">
    <tr>
    {% for j in (1..9) %}
      <td style="width:25%"><a href="/art/Princeton/sculpture/resized/00{{ j }}.jpg"><img src="/art/Princeton/sculpture/thumbs/00{{ j }}.jpg" style="width:100%;"></a></td>
    {% assign row = forloop.index | modulo:4 %}
    {% if row == 0 %}
    </tr>
    <tr>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% for j in (0..6) %}
      <td style="width:25%"><a href="/art/Princeton/sculpture/resized/01{{ j }}.jpg"><img src="/art/Princeton/sculpture/thumbs/01{{ j }}.jpg" style="width:100%;"></a></td>
    {% assign row = forloop.index | modulo:4 %}
    {% if row == 3 and j != 6 %}
    </tr>
    <tr>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    </tr>
  </table>
