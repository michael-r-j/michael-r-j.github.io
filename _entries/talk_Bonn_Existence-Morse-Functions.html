<p>
This before you are notes for a talk given in a seminar on the \(h\)-Cobordism Theorem based on the text by J. Milnor of similar name, [Mil65]. Specifically, the notes focus on chapter 2 of the text, from ¶2.5 until its end; the topic is the existence of Morse functions on arbitrary cobordism \(( W ; V_{0} , V_{1} )\) with a smooth structure.
