The aim of this overview is to outline notions that build up to the description of Calabi-Yau manifolds; with that, literature that generalizes this notion will be discussed. To start off, a differential geometric approach via holonomy will be taken and a specific kind of complex manifold will be introduced, a KÃ¤hler manifold, of which a Calabi-Yau manifold is a specific kind determined by holonomy. Therewith, the final aim of this paper is to discuss generalizing the idea of a Calabi-Yau manifold, as done in the work of Hitchin [Hit02][Hit10] and Gualtieri [Gua03], his recent PhD student.
