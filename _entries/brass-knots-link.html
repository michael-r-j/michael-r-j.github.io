<i>brass</i>
<p>
  This is a collection of brass mathematical objects made in the course <i>Arbeiten mit Buntmetall</i> led by Judith Fegerl in the winter semester of 2022 at the Angewandte.  To accompany her work in her show, Judith selected a few students pieces to be presented.<br>
  The collection comprises a model of the Borromean rings (»Borromean axes«), and two prime knots (»3-fold« and »5-fold«).  This is the start of a longer-term series of such objects.<br><br>
