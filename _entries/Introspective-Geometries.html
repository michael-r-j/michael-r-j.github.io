<i>transparencies, ink, creases</i>
<p>
  This project consists of a series of drawings investigating paper both passively as a surface for drawing and actively as a tool of drawing.  Its use of transparent paper is to fall essentially unto paper as a vehicle and delimiter of form.  Each drawing explores the act of introspection — reflecting, turning, and folding inwards — to not only find form but also be formed.  It is about the dualized interplay of the re-flexive <i>itself</i> forming and being formed by the ef-flexive (outward-pointing flexion) <i>its self</i>.  Through the process of folding and line making from its edge, each paper becomes a support for spatial drawing: as the paper folds to delineate form on <i>itself</i>, it finds a form for <i>its self</i>.
