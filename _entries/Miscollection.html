<p>
  A series of wooden placards, with a repeating painted motif and a single hole for a nail, by which they could be affixed to a wall. These placards were placed in the space in various states of installation to suggest the on‐going, active process of "collecting", as opposed to the static display of a "collection". The title of the piece is to convey that, together, these placard objects form a group as independent objects. But as one looks at the objects relative to each other, the repeating motif with its obstructed or missing details, suggest they form a sort of "collection of those, which are incomplete": as puzzle pieces in a "miscollection", together they suggest a whole, a "complete piece of obtainable information", which is not graspable from each alone, let alone fathomable. Inspiration for this work came the prompt to form a means of advertising oneself: this was interpreted as the task of developing a means of forming, and then disseminating, identity. The idea for this work was to simulate the typical, indirect uncovering of one's identity, as completed over the course of several singular moments, or "informational snapshots": the fragments of what is revealed versus what is hidden over the course of time, that eventually suggest, and sum up to, a more complete — though ever‐changing — picture of oneself, as shown to the world.<br><br>

  This is an on-going work, with new iterations being constructed and construed — always bundled with at least a hammer and nails for installation.
