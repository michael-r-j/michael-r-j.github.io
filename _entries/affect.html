<i>copper and steel wire, crocheted cotton, acid, salt, wooden frame, two L-shaped nails</i>
<p>
  We come to be at the intersections, in the push and pull of boundaries.  We give to be received.  We support to be held.  We shape to be formed.  We find our selves across the social ether, through confronting an other.  Relationships take from each to make an us: bodies as actor and acted upon, of exchanges and combinations.<br>

  The cotton support is the interface of exposed materials, made vulnerable by contact with acid and salt.  The interplay of the substances leaves its mark on the cotton, as the materials rust and patina.  As this relationship continues to develop over time, not only will the colors of the pigments left on the cotton change, but also the cotton itself will begin to discolor further and degrade from the residues of the acid.<br><br>

  It is a memory of a reaction that changes itself as its self changes.<br>
