      <td style="width:75px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;"><u>Synopsis</u>:</td> <td>Starting from near foundations, the theory of the calculus of variations was developed in the semi-Riemannian setting. Using appropriate results from the theory and contextual material, two main theorems were proven regarding (in)completeness based on curvature bounds: the Bonnet-Myers (completeness) theorem in the Riemannian context, and one of Hawkingâ€™s singularity (incompleteness) theorems in the Lorentzian context.
