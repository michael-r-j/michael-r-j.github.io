§1 Recalling some operators, and results, from the previous talk, but, instead, having them act on the exterior bundles, and their sections, of some complex manifold \(X\) – in particular one with a Kähler structure.<br>
§2 Computing the various Kähler Identities, which involve the aforementioned operators on Kähler \(X\).
